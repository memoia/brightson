=========

This is me learning how to program in C#, by way of Mono on OS X.
I want to make something that uses the JSON.NET library and the
IDictionary container. *Maybe* add an SSIS-type task (or at least
a DLL for one) that can be "smart" about transforming arbitrary JSON
to table data (partially by using an EAV model or something).

Uses:
* [MonoFramework-MDK-2.10.11](http://download.mono-project.com/archive/2.10.11/macos-10-x86/MonoFramework-MDK-2.10.11.macos10.xamarin.x86.dmg)
* [Json.NET 5.0 Release 6](http://json.codeplex.com)
